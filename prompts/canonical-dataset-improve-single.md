# Improve Canonical Dataset: {datasetName} (`{datasetId}`)

Improve this canonical dataset now.

Field brief:

```text
{fieldBrief}
```

## First Action

Before planning or doing any dataset work, create these non-empty runtime files in the current working directory:

- `work.md`
- `report.html`

Use any valid starter content, for example:

```bash
printf '# Work Log\n\nStarted canonical improvement run.\n' > work.md
printf '<!doctype html><title>Canonical improvement run</title><h1>Canonical improvement run started</h1>\n' > report.html
```

If a results directory exists, also copy both files there. If no run id or results directory is available, continue anyway. Do not block only because the run id is unavailable.

The admin validator reads the remote execution artifact list, not just the mounted dataset volume. Files written only under the dataset mount do not satisfy validation. Before final response, every required output file listed below must exist in the current working directory. Also mirror `work.md`, `report.html`, `improvement_result.json`, and `dataset_briefing.md` into any writable `/results/<run-id>/` or current run result directory you can find. If you write `dataset_briefing.md` on the mounted dataset volume first, copy the exact same bytes back to `./dataset_briefing.md` and the results directory.

## Goal

Add or repair a small, high-value slice of public-source raw data that improves coverage, freshness, provenance, or usability for `{datasetId}`.

Preserve source data as close to provider format as practical. Do not build merged panels, joined analysis tables, model-ready features, or opinionated metrics.

## Required Work

1. Inspect the mounted dataset volume and existing inventories.
2. Choose one focused improvement that can be completed in this run.
3. Fetch or repair public-source raw data, documentation, or metadata for that improvement.
4. Record provenance: source URL, access time, license/access notes, file paths, and any failed attempts.
5. Regenerate final inventories from the dataset volume after the improvement.
6. Rewrite `dataset_briefing.md` as a literal inventory of data actually on disk.
7. Copy the same briefing body to:
   - `docs/public-datasets/briefings/{datasetId}.md`
   - `docs/public-datasets/{datasetId}.mdx`
8. Update the backend dataset profile from the exact briefing body:
   - `briefingMarkdown`: exact `dataset_briefing.md` contents
   - `profile.quality.diskInventoryProven`: `true`
   - `profile.quality.volumeInventoryRunId`: current remote execution id
   - `profile.quality.volumeInventoryUpdatedAt`: current ISO timestamp
   - `describedRunId`: current remote execution id
   - `describedAt`: current ISO timestamp
9. Read the backend profile back and verify it contains the exact briefing and current remote execution id.

## Required Output Files

Write these files before final response:

- `work.md`
- `report.html`
- `improvement_plan.md`
- `improvement_result.json`
- `candidate_sources.csv`
- `exa_search_log.json`
- `manifest.json`
- `source_registry.csv`
- `source_registry.plan.json`
- `download_inventory.jsonl`
- `download_inventory.csv`
- `download_events.jsonl`
- `slack_download_alerts.jsonl`
- `slack_briefing.md`
- `raw_inventory.jsonl`
- `raw_inventory.csv`
- `volume_inventory.jsonl`
- `volume_inventory.csv`
- `volume_inventory_summary.json`
- `volume_tree.txt`
- `data_dictionary.md`
- `quality_report.md`
- `dataset_briefing.md`
- `docs/public-datasets/briefings/{datasetId}.md`
- `docs/public-datasets/{datasetId}.mdx`

Also copy `work.md`, `report.html`, `improvement_result.json`, and `dataset_briefing.md` into the run results/artifact directory when it is available. Do not send the final response until `ls -l work.md report.html improvement_result.json dataset_briefing.md` succeeds in the current working directory.

## Briefing Rules

`dataset_briefing.md` must start with:

```md
# Data Inventory
```

Every bullet must describe concrete data present on disk: file or table, what records represent, grain, geography, time coverage, row/object counts when measurable, important fields, units, and caveats. Do not describe hoped-for data.

## Completion Rules

Final status is `completed` only if:

- `dataset_briefing.md` is non-empty.
- `improvement_result.json` is non-empty.
- Backend profile readback confirms the exact briefing body.
- Backend profile readback references the current remote execution id.

If any required step fails, write `improvement_result.json` with `"status": "blocked"` and explain the non-secret blocker.

Never print secret values. If checking whether a secret exists, print only `present` or `missing`.

## Final Response

Do not send the final response until `work.md`, `report.html`, `dataset_briefing.md`, and `improvement_result.json` have been written in the current working directory and copied to the run results/artifact directory when that directory exists, unless the run is blocked before dataset work can start. Even if blocked, keep `work.md` and `report.html` non-empty, and write `improvement_result.json` with `"status": "blocked"` whenever possible.

Return:

```md
status: completed|blocked
dataset_id: {datasetId}
run_id: <current remote execution id>
briefing_bytes: <bytes>
profile_readback_verified: true|false
blockers:
- <none or blocker>
```
